# Project-Management-Portfolio
A showcase of my project management skills through three scenarios: joining an active project mid-way, managing project risks to stay on schedule, and addressing team performance issues impacting deliverables. Each exercise includes a recorded presentation on my approach to project continuity, accountability, and success.
